# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## Deploying your project

It's worth noting that you may run into a [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) error once you host your project that prevents the API request from succeeding. To prevent this, you'll need to research proxy servers or how to implement one yourself. As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommended hosts for this challenge (because they allow for serverless functions if needed for the proxy) are:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).
